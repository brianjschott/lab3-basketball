# Lab 3 - Code a Basketball Game

## Objectives
Students will be able to build out a class for a basketball Team in the Team.java file, adding in the necessary properties and methods for the team "blueprint." Then, in the Game.java file, students will be able to create two team objects and call the objects' methods.

#### All instructions for what to add are in the comments of both files. Read them carefully!

## How to Set Up and Run Lab
This lab looks a little different than our previous labs. Two files?! What do I do?! Have no fear. One of the files, Game.java has a **main method** inside of it. This looks like `public static void main(String[] args)`. We need to compile both files and then run the Game.java file.
1. Edit your code and add in the requested features.
2. Use the command line to run the javac command on both of the files. (`javac Team.java` and `javac Game.java`)
3. Use the command line to run the java command on the Game.java file. (`java Game.java`)

##### Note: This only works if both files are in the same directory. Otherwise, you'll have use `import` to indicate the path to the other file.
